        <h1>Putin Apologises for Taking Ukraine Land</h1>
        <h4>On Saturday Russian president Valdimir Putin made a formal statement,
            in front of NATO leaders, to Ukranian president Petro Poroshenko. Putin stated that he was "very sorry" and "didn't realise" what he was doing as he thought the land was 'unclaimed'. Putin is now working closley
          with Ukraine in an effort to rebuild the relationship, yet doesnt appear to have any plans of returning the taken land. In a statement made by the NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, he states that he his glad
        Putin now sees his mistake and is willing to turn a blind eye on the past if the two countries 'cooperate from this point forward'.</h4>

        </figure><p>The Russian intervention has been in progress in the Ukraine since 2014. Pro-Russian militants have admitted to Russian military troop assisting the revolt since 2014 and in August of the same year pro-Russian forces allied with the military
        successfully annexed the Crimean peninsula. Following these incidents Russian BPM-97s were spotted in Luhansk and other settlements along the Eastern Ukrainien border with Russia. In addition to military vehicals Russia employed a distraction strategy,
        sending in unmarked 'white lorries' and 'trucks' through check points. Ukrainien accounts state <q cite="Ukrainien press release">There was verry little in these trucks, atleast nothing to cause suspicion.</q> It was believed that these were to act as distraction
        while forces made there way in through both unmanned and un-official border crossings. Since 2014 Russia and Pro-Russian forces have been steadily pushing into the Ukraine taking small towns and farmland</p>

        </figure><p>It is currently unknown how much land the joint forces have taken however a spokes person from NATO has said that the estimate is much higher that initially thought. From September 3rd Ukrainien President Poroshenko confirmed that they had reached a perminent
        ceasefire agreement with the Russian forces. However Russia later denied this stating <q>... we haven't been a party in the war, the claims made are against the 'Pro-Russian' Ukrainiens only.</q> The 3rd of September also observed the OSCE (Organization for Security
         and Co-operation in Europe) reporting <q>...Light  and heavy caliber shootings from the east and shout-east ares which are also bordering Ukraine.</q> The report also stated that an increase of military-style dressed men crossing the border in both directions with
        wounded being transported back to Russia.</p>
